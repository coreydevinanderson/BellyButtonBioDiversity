Belly button biodiversity dashboard

This repository uses Javascript, with D3.js and Plotly to demonstrate a simple dashboard. The data represnt counts of unique taxa of micro-organisms found in each belly button (= sample_values).

Select a subject ID from the dropdown menu to generate (or change) the figure outputs.

There are three plots: 
  1) a bar plot,  
  2) a bubble chart,  
  3) a gauge chart. 

There is also a panel that contains the metadata for each individual.
